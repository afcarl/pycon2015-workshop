#Welcome to Cloudpipe at PyCon 2015!

## Preparation/Installation

You'll have to use Python 2 for this workshop and install our `multyvac` fork:

```
pip install vac
```

:warning: If you already had multyvac installed, you'll likely want to delete `~/.multyvac`. Also note that installing `vac` does overwrite the `multyvac` package.

## Simple demo

```python
>>> import multyvac
>>> multyvac.config.set_key(api_key=<RACKSPACE USER>, api_secret_key=<RACKSPACE API KEY>)

>>> import requests
>>> job_id = multivac.submit(lambda: requests.get('https://developer.rackspace.com').status_code)
>>> job = multyvac.get(job_id)
>>> job.get_result()
```
